PROGRAM TITLE : KlanScape Ultimate Web Browser (2nd Release)
PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS: Visual Basic 6, Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control,
                      Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Thank you for your interest in improving your programming skills!
This my project (source code) for a program I call, KlanScape Ultimate Browser.

This browser has the ability to filter webpages, detect content of webpages,
gather information on webpages, and edit webpages in live. Here are just a few
things you can already do with this program:

* Determine information about a website you are visiting
including Title, URL, date created, domain name, and file size.

* Display active certificates and cookies for the site you are on.

* Block popup windows, warn of popup windows, and decide how to handle them
including opening in a new KlanScape window or Internet Explorer window.

* Extract site elements into clear categories, including Document Elements,
Links (URLs), Images, and Buttons/Inputs.

* List all of links on the page you are on, and count how many there are.

* Find the content of the page you are on, including source code, by using
the filter setting you decide. Then, decide what custom filters you want to use;
including the ability to alert, redirect your browser, or block a site based
on the content that is found on the site.

* Edit web sites in real-time using different methods. Design Mode allows you to
control anything on the site, including editing text and images while the site is
still open in active, including CGI, Perl, Secure, and Encoded sites. The other
is to edit or write to the document using HTML elements including modifying the page
colors and CSS in real-time.

* Shows the active element (what you have selected in the web browser) under
'Active Element' and edit it anyway you want, delete it, or replace it in real-time,
anytime you want to.

* View a text-only version of the webpage you are visiting, supports CGI, PHP, ect.

* Inspect the source code with a very simple (easier to use than Notepad) built-in
text edit that includes great tools such as 'Does string exist' and
'Find a string between'.

* A bar which covers the top of the entire windows screen to alert you of
important messages, it will close when you click it.
